# ESP8266-car-battery-monitor-to-EasyIoT
Small diy project to monitor the 12V car battery voltage of a vehicle in winter storage.
A learning project for ESP8266 usage with lots of my self learning of Arduino and C++ language
A lot of using examples found elsewhere, glued together with beginner code from me.
Also uses a DS18B20 temp sensor because it was fun to include...
